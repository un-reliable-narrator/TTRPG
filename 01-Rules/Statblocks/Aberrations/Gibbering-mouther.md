## Gibbering Mouther

*Ravenous Chorus of Unreality*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Gibbering mouthers endlessly feed on and regrow their own amoeboid bodies—amorphous heaps roiling with eyes, teeth, and strange organs. These mind-bending terrors sing and scream, laugh and cry with a cacophony of voices ranging from disturbingly unnatural to shockingly familiar. They exist only to feed and to unleash their disdain for reality, their many maws dripping with otherworldly spittle.

Gibbering mouthers come into being in various unpleasant ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Gibbering Mouther Nascencies table to inspire what brought one of these horrors into being.

**Gibbering Mouther Nascencies**

| dice: 1d6 | The Gibbering Mouther Is... |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Another creature warped by dangerous magic. |
| 2 | The autonomous appendage of a chaotic deity, Far Realm entity, or star-spawn horror. |
| 3 | The experiment of an aberrant manipulator. |
| 4 | Part of the life cycle of some other Aberration. |
| 5 | A shape-shifter that lost control of its powers. |
| 6 | Someone cursed by a cult or vengeful deity. |
