# [Mindwitness](Mindwitness-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 181*  

If a beholder is [stunned](Conditions.md#Stunned) and brought to the brine pool of an elder brain, the beholder can be converted into a mindwitness. This alters some of its eye rays and transforms four of its eyestalks into tentacles similar to a mind flayer's. The mindwitness is psychically imprinted with devotion to the elder brain and submission to illithid commands.

A mindwitness's primary function is to improve telepathic communication in a mind flayer colony. A creature in telepathic communication with a mindwitness can converse through it to as many as seven other creatures the mindwitness can see, rapidly disseminating commands and other information.

If separated from its illithid masters, a mindwitness seeks out other telepathic creatures to tell it what to do. Mindwitnesses have been known to ally with [flumphs](flumph.md) and planar beings such as demons, shifting their worldview and alignment to match those of their new masters.
