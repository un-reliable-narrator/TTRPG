## Flumph

*Strange Ally from a Strange Place*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Bizarre creatures with aberrant agendas inhabit the Underdark. Flumphs number among the few that are helpful to strangers.

These tentacled, telepathic creatures jet through the air in short bursts, venting gases with a sound that gives them their name. Rather than speaking, flumphs communicate telepathically and by changing color to reflect their moods.

Flumphs dwell in psychically charged regions or near creatures with psionic magic. They harmlessly feed off psychic energies, but in doing so, they often encounter dangerous beings such as aboleths and mind flayers. While flumphs generally avoid combat, they often help adventurers in peril. Such help might be of doubtful use, but flumphs mean well. Roll on or choose a result from the Flumph Assistance table to inspire what support flumphs provide.
