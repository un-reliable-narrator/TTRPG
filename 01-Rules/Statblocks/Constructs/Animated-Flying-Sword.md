*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 17. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Animated flying swords move as if wielded by unseen warriors. Whether an animated blade is newly forged or a constellation of broken fragments, the object behaves the same. Other weapons from the "Player's Handbook" can also be animated and use game statistics similar to those here.

## Animated Objects

*Mundane Objects Come to Life*

- **Habitat.** Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Magic can manipulate mundane items, compelling them to perform simple tasks. Such animate objects might be unassuming tools or decorations that can defend their creator. These objects follow simple instructions from whatever force or magic-user created them. If left unattended, they might defend an area for ages or repeat a task until they wear out.

Roll on or choose a result from the Animated Object Catalysts table to inspire what sort of magic motivates an ambulatory item.
