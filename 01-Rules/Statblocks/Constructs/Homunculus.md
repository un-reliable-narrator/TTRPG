## Homunculus

*Winged Servant Given Magical Life*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** None  

A mage can create a cat Sized, obedient assistant called a homunculus through a ritual that uses the mage's blood. Each homunculus shares a telepathic bond with the mage who created it and loyally serves its creator. A homunculus is reduced to inert material if its creator dies.

A homunculus's appearance reflects its creator's tastes. Roll on or choose a result from the Homunculus Features table to inspire a homunculus's form.
