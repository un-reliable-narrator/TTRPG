## Flesh Golem

*Dead Flesh Given New Life*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Flesh golems are roughly human-shaped collections of body parts bound together by misused magic or strange science. They serve their reckless creators, but many possess disjointed memories and instincts from their component parts. If wounded, these golems might go berserk and vent their confusion on anything in their sight, including their creators.

Flesh golems appear in varied forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Flesh Golem Characteristics table to inspire a flesh golem's features.

| 3 | Missing parts and exposed insides. |
| 4 | Parts serving unintended roles, like a body composed of dozens of hands. |
| 5 | Perfect features accented by beautiful stitching. |
| 6 | Visible mechanisms, bellows, and engines. |
