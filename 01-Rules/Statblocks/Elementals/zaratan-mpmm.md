# [Zaratan](zaratan-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 278*  

When a zaratan is summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth, the ground rises up to take the shape of a hulking, armored reptile. A zaratan's steps trigger shock waves severe enough to level structures. It expresses its rage through trumpeting calls and the occasional boulder or blast of debris it spews from its cavernous maw. If seriously injured, a zaratan retracts its appendages to gain shelter beneath its impervious shell, biding its time until it recovers and can resume its march.

      \ is [concentrating](conditions.md#Concentration) must\

      \ is broken. The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact\
      \ with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses,\
      \ the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's\
      \ height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\
      \ takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone),\
      \ and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained),\
      \ requiring a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Athletics))\
      \ check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried\
      \ creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check.\
      \ If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic\
      \ success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and\
