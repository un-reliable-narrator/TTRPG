Satyr revelmasters use magical music to change the moods of other creatures. They do so to keep their celebrations exciting and to ward off foes.

## Satyrs

*Horned and Hoofed Revelers*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** [Implements](random-magic-items-implements.md)  

Satyrs embody the untamed joys of the wilderness. They indulge in sprees of merrymaking—eating, drinking, performing, fighting, and frolicking.
