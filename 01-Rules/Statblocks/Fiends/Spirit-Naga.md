## Spirit Naga

*Spiteful Serpentine Grudge Keeper*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Lower Planes), Underdark  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Spirit nagas loathe the world and all creatures. Possessing perfect memories, these venomous, cobra-like creatures recall every slight committed against them during their immortal existences. In their dank, joyless lairs, they create vicious plots to avenge themselves against even petty offenses.

Spirit nagas seek to claim what they believe they deserve. Their schemes often involve poisons, vile spells, cursed objects, or magical compulsions, eventually making them wellsprings of diabolical knowledge and evil inspiration. Other villains often seek out spirit nagas as advisers and allies. Roll on or choose a result from the Spirit Naga Grievances table to inspire what motivates a spirit naga's schemes.
