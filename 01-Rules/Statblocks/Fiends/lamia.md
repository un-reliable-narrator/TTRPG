## Lamia

*Accursed Bargainer and Ruin Raider*

- **Habitat.** Desert  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Legends say the first lamia was an ambitious ruler who made a sinister bargain with the demon lord Graz'zt for everlasting majesty. As a consequence, the ruler was transformed into a lamia, a monster with the body of a lion and an accursed touch.

Lamias either are descendants of that first lamia or have made similar deals. They often dwell near ruins, seeking mysterious magic they can use to gain riches and influence. Lamias use magical illusions and enchantments to trick others into serving them. They sometimes work with bandits to abduct travelers, releasing captives only if they accept a dangerous bargain. Roll on or choose a result from the Lamia Pacts table to inspire a lamia's desires.
