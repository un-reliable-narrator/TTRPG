Illusionists twist light, sound, and even thought to create illusory effects. Some illusionists are delightful entertainers, while others are devilish tricksters.

## Wizards

Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.
