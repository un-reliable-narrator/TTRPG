## Manticore

*Winged, Leonine People-Eater*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Coastal, Grassland, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** Any  

With lion-like claws, leathery wings, and broad jaws filled with rows of sharp teeth, manticores ambush travelers from above and devour them. Manticores crave the taste of humans, but lacking their favored prey, they eagerly consume other peoples and livestock.

Manticores have tails bristling with detachable spikes. These monsters launch their tail spikes at their prey, skewering those on the ground or knocking flying creatures from the air.

Despite their ravenous tendencies, manticores enjoy speaking with those they're about to devour. Sometimes they make agreements with their prey. Roll on or choose a result from the Manticore Negotiations table to inspire what a manticore might offer in exchange for a more tempting meal.
