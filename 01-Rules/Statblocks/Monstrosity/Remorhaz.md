Full-grown remorhazes are single-minded ambush predators. They attempt to bite prey and trap it against their searing bodies, then swallow their meal whole. Remorhazes eat as much as they can, since they might go months without feeding.

## Remorhazes

*Super-Heated Arctic Arthropods*

- **Habitat.** Arctic  
- **Treasure.** None  

Remorhazes are centipede-like terrors that burrow through snow and ice to ambush smaller creatures that trespass in their frozen territories.
