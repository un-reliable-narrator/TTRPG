## Wererat
*Changed by the Deviousness of the Rat*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Wererats can shape-shift from their humanoid forms into giant rats or humanoid-rat hybrids. These creatures can transform voluntarily, but some are magically compelled to shape-shift when exposed to complete darkness or during nights of a new moon. Often, wererats' nature results from a divine curse—punishment for their deceitful natures or the crimes of their treacherous families. Wererats frequently work in groups, forming bandit gangs or thieves' guilds.
