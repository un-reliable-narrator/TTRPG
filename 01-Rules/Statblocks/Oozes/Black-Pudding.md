## Black Pudding

*Divisible, Corrosive Blob*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Black puddings are shapeless masses of predatory cells. Once a pudding detects organic matter, it oozes toward its prey, dissolving living matter and various objects. If a black pudding is split by lightning or slashing attacks, it divides into two smaller, independent puddings.

Various supernatural conditions might bring black puddings into being. Roll on or choose a result from the Black Pudding Sources table to inspire a pudding's origins.
