# Tree Blight
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 44*  

Tree blights look like ancient, dead trees with gnarled limbs and splintered hollows. Imbued with bloodlust, these blights feed on the living. Evidence of their past meals is often tangled amid their branches and roots. Tree blights cooperate with other blights, but they attack other tree-shaped beings they encounter, such as awakened trees and treants.

## Blights

*Plants Sprouted from Evil*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** None  

Blights are malicious plants that sprout from deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures. While blights can act independently, they're usually motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned them or by wicked creatures with control over nature. The magic that creates blights often affects other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines, and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields, choke wells and streams, and force animals from their natural habitat. This might make blights the first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.
