Skeletons are reanimated Humanoid bones bearing the equipment they had in life. They have rudimentary faculties and greater agility than zombies and similar shambling corpses. While they aren't capable of creating plans of their own, they avoid obvious barriers and self-destructive situations.

## Skeletons

*Ossified Evil*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

**Skeleton Pantomimes**
