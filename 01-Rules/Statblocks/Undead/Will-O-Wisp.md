## Will-o'-Wisp

*Guide on the Path to Doom*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Swamp, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

From a distance, will-o'-wisps look like lanterns bobbing in the dark. Through the windows of abandoned structures or around the bends of treacherous paths, these spirits tempt the curious into peril. Once their prey is vulnerable, will-o'-wisps feed on the life force of those they lay low.

Roll on or choose a result from the Will-o'-Wisp Ambushes table to inspire how a will-o'-wisp imperils its victims.
