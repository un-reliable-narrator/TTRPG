## Wraith

*Essence of Evil*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Wraiths are spectral evils, life-hungry embodiments of malice and terror. Arising from the souls of tyrants, moments of catastrophic pain, or magical blasphemies, wraiths spread suffering and the torment of undeath. Humanoids that die near a wraith might be entrapped by the foul spirit and rise as specters bound to the wraith's sinister will.

Wraiths lurk in forgotten dungeons, accursed ruins, or lands influenced by sinister planes of existence. Such haunted domains might bear hints of the tragedies or foul magic that brought the wraiths into being.

Wraiths might arise from a single powerfully evil soul or other baleful forces. Roll on or choose a result from the Wraith Manifestations table to inspire the wickedness a wraith embodies.
