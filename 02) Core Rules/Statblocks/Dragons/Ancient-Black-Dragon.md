# [Ancient Black Dragon](Ancient-Black-Dragon.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 40. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Ancient black dragons plot the ruin of whole realms. They seek magic to corrupt the land, raise undead hordes, bind fiends, and replicate magical disasters. Ancient black dragons strive to create vast, dead domains where they are the greatest things that remain.

## Black Dragons

*Dragons of Decay and Despair*

- **Habitat.** Swamp  
- **Treasure.** [Relics](random-magic-items-relics.md)  

Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While other chromatic dragons scheme for power and wealth, these dragons seek to tear down all they see and rule over what remains.

Black dragons are terrifying creatures with curved horns and withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant swamps, crumbling ruins, or places of magical or environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars their domains, eroding the features from ancient statues and leaving nature with festering wounds.

Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope and relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons prize it—particularly if they were responsible for it being lost.

### Black Dragon Lairs

Black dragons lurk in dismal ruins, polluted bogs, or other sites gripped by decay.
