Like arctic storms, ancient white dragons threaten icy realms. They emerge from their frozen lairs to indulge their hungers for food or treasure, menacing other creatures with lethal cold. While they might ignore animals or small groups of polar wanderers, these dragons are quick to challenge other dragons and creatures wielding powerful magic, hoping to add their foes' skulls and magic items to their own hoards.

## White Dragons

*Dragons of Cold and Cruelty*

- **Habitat.** Arctic  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Among the most primal chromatic dragons, white dragons prioritize survival over all. Life is harsh and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons fiercely protect their territories, scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white dragons ignore the plots of smaller creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only with their own survival.

White dragons create lairs to defend themselves from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural conditions. Within these shelters, white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls, the gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest. To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victory—the details of which inflate as these dragons age.

### White Dragon Lairs

White dragons brood in bitterly cold lairs clawed from stone and ice.
