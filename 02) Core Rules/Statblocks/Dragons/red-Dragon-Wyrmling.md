# [Red Dragon Wyrmling](red-Dragon-Wyrmling.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 254. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Red dragon wyrmlings are born destroyers. From a young age, they delight in igniting objects and creatures alike. They sometimes restrain themselves from scorching creatures to instead bully others into following their orders and bringing them gifts.

## Red Dragons

*Dragons of Greed and Devastation*

- **Habitat.** Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Red dragons take whatever they desire and burn to ash anything that stands in their way. These chromatic dragons endlessly desire more—more magic, territory, treasure, or whatever else inflames their cruel ambitions.

Red dragons make their lairs amid perilous cliffs and volcanoes. Within, they amass and fiercely protect hoards of treasure, and many have perfect recall of the hoards' contents and the locations of all they've collected. Should anything go missing, red dragons fly into rages. They don't rest until their treasures are returned and the thieves have burned.

Red dragons believe themselves to be the greatest of all dragons and, by extension, the greatest of all creatures. To them, pillaging and conquering are their right—treasures can find no more honored place than in their hoards, and other creatures are privileged to serve them.

### Red Dragon Lairs

Red dragons make their lairs in smoldering, unapproachable places such as volcanic mountains, burning wastelands, and ruins they've stolen from other creatures.
