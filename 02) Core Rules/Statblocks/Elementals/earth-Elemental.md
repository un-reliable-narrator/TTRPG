## Earth Elemental

*Primal Spirit of Soil and Stone*

- **Habitat.** Mountain, Planar (Elemental Plane of Earth), Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Primal spirits from the Elemental Plane of Earth merge with rocks and minerals to form earth elementals. These beings possess powerful limbs and coarse features, sometimes studded with ore, gems, crystals, colorful striations, or living plants. On the Material Plane, earth elementals often serve those who conjure them, or they appear in regions influenced by their home plane, such as crystalline nodes, energetic fault lines, or veins of magical ore. Earth elementals effortlessly move through stone and can bring ruin to whole structures with their mighty fists.

Earth elementals are typically made of more than dirt. While an elemental's composition doesn't change its statistics or have monetary value, it makes each elemental distinct. Roll on or choose a result from the Earth Elemental Compositions table to inspire an earth elemental's features.
