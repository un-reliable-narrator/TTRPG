## Water Elemental

*Primal Spirit of Waves and Tides*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Planar (Elemental Plane of Water), Swamp, Underwater  
- **Treasure.** None  

Spirits of the Elemental Plane of Water form shapeless liquids into water elementals, aqueous beings with the might of surging waves. Water elementals are as mutable as liquid, allowing them to crash into foes and seep through narrow cracks. They can crush foes with limb-like geysers, or they might flood over creatures, submerging and drowning foes within their whirling forms. Water elementals often appear near nexuses of elemental power, such as aquatic abysses, magical springs, and whirlpools.

Water elementals' shapes are influenced by the liquid bodies in which they form. Roll on or choose a result from the Water Elemental Compositions table to inspire a water elemental's features.
