# [Bullywug Warrior](bullywug-Warrior.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 64. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

Bullywug warriors are adept at moving through swamps and ambushing trespassers. They often work alongside packs of trained giant frogs.

## Bullywugs

*Amphibious Appreciators of Marsh and Muck*

- **Habitat.** Swamp  
- **Treasure.** [Implements](random-magic-items-implements.md), Individual  

Fey embodiments of swamplands, bullywugs protect the murky wilds and consider themselves cosmically favored for that role. These human-size, toad- or frog-like creatures have close relationships with the creatures of the swamp.
