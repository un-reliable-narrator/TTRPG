## Ice Devil

*Devil of Antipathy and Intellectual Arrogance*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Heartless strategists of the Nine Hells, ice devils—also known as gelugons—forsake emotion to indulge in their own malicious interpretations of logic. For them, the multiverse is a puzzle that must be solved to benefit them, their masters, and the Nine Hells.

Ice devils act maliciously, disguising their whims as reason and strategy. In the service of evil masters, these insectile devils patiently plot the movements of infernal armies and scheme ways to fulfill wicked goals. They might also serve as guardians, owing to their martial prowess and ability to reshape battlefields with walls of ice.

When indulging their own schemes, ice devils tempt mortals to forsake empathy and social connections to embrace selfish, destructive visions of intellectualism. After isolating victims, these devils drain them of their secrets or send them forth to spread fractious dogmas cloaked as reason.

Ice devils usually lurk in frozen realms, particularly the frigid layer of Cania in the Nine Hells.
