## Nalfeshnee

*Demon of Intimidation and Hopelessness*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** [Relics](random-magic-items-relics.md)  

Nalfeshnees seek to dominate all they encounter. Hulking and grotesque, these demons combine misshapen, bestial features with ogre-like frames. Through both brute force and cunning, nalfeshnees compel cultists and weaker demons to serve them in the endless conflicts of the Abyss or in plots on the Material Plane.

Many nalfeshnees view themselves as prospective demon lords and seek to conquer realms of their own. They often use promises of fiendish magic or Abyssal alliances to tempt ambitious mortals into ruinous pacts. Should they run out of patience, nalfeshnees conjure visions of the Abyss and other nightmares to terrorize others into obeying.

> The Blood War—that ageless clash between devils and demons—helps ensure the balance of the multiverse. At times it makes unlikely allies, but never delude yourself into believing there's a lesser of two evil. I won't be thanking a demon for every day I'm spared a devil's lash.
