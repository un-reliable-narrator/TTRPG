## Nycaloth

*Yugoloth of Strategy and Strife*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Gehenna)  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Fiendish warmongers, nycaloths relish combat and conquest. These tremendous winged yugoloths teleport around battlefields and into the air to bewilder their foes and attack with constantly shifting, Gehenna-forged axes—mercurial weapons similar to those favored by many yugoloths.

Nycaloths might command groups of mezzoloths and make pacts to serve arcanaloths, ultroloths, fiendish warlords, or wicked mortals. So long as they can indulge their bloodlust, most nycaloths are willing to obey more powerful or cunning creatures. Some even serve competent leaders past the terms of their agreements to achieve long-pursued victories. But masters that lead nycaloths to defeat should fear these proud yugoloths' retribution.

Nycaloths and other yugoloths frequently serve as mercenary forces in extraplanar conflicts that spill onto the Material Plane. Roll on or choose a result from the Yugoloth Incursions table to inspire the plans of a yugoloth war band.
