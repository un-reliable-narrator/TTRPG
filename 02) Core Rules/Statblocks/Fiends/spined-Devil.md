## Spined Devil

*Devil of Intrusion and Suspicion*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Spined devils, also known as spinagons, lurk in the shadows of the Lower Planes, seeking secrets for their infernal lords. They prefer to attack from the air, flinging wicked barbs while staying out of reach of foes. Spined devils collect information to gain leverage over mortals or to entice powerful devils. Roll on or choose a result from the Spined Devil Intelligence table to inspire what information a spined devil seeks or already possesses.
