## Frost Giant

*Giant of the Ice and Snow*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

From glacial mountain heights and vast tundras rise the homes of frost giants. These giants have skin and hair of icy hues. Their natural immunity to cold allows them to flourish in places inhospitable to most other creatures. They use this resilience to aid them when hunting and in combat, bolstering their allies with chilling war cries.

Frost giants often travel far to find food and goods. This leads many to become raiders and earn violent reputations. Others live more peaceably by hunting titanic game or creating sanctuaries from the cold (frequently featuring hot springs or snowy contests). Frost giants sometimes forge partnerships with icy Fey or fire giants dwelling underground, serving as guardians to their realms in exchange for treasure, weapons, and crafts.
