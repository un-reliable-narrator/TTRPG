The grung stat block represents a typical grung warrior or hunter, met either in a grung community or traveling elsewhere as a mercenary, game warden, guard, or bandit.

## Grungs

Grungs are frog-like folk found in rain forests and tropical jungles. These amphibians prefer shade and live in trees, but they maintain hatcheries for their offspring in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult, and after another six months, the grung reaches maturity.

Born in a wide range of colors, grungs most often appear in shades of green, blue, purple, red, orange, and gold. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures, and sometimes that substance has a special effect based on the grung's color (see "Variant: Grung Poison"). They also use this venom to poison their weapons.
