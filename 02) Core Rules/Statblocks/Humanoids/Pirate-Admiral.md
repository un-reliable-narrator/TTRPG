Pirate admirals command whole pirate fleets. They undertake audacious ventures, such as challenging the navies of coastal nations, hunting legendary sea creatures, or carving out their own pirate kingdoms. Pirate admirals might launch their fleets from hidden fortresses where they hoard their treasure—or keep maps to where they've hidden their riches. Some pirate admirals ally with the followers of oceanic deities, underwater dwellers, and sea monsters, as well as their fellow scalawags.

## Pirates

*Freebooters and Fortune Hunters*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Individual, [Implements](random-magic-items-implements.md)  

The term "pirate" encompasses a broad range of seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers, cursed treasure hunters, and others who seek riches and fame on the seas.

Pirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some combination thereof. While they are the bane of merchants and coastal communities, they know secrets of the sea and how to avoid aquatic threats. More unusual pirates set their sights beyond the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels, plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore and raid incredible realms.

### Pirate Flags
