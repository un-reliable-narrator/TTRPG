Along with being competent warriors, pirates are accomplished seafarers who know how to sail and maintain a ship. While some loyally follow their captains' orders, others place greed, superstition, or self-preservation over duty.

## Pirates

*Freebooters and Fortune Hunters*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Individual, [Implements](random-magic-items-implements.md)  

The term "pirate" encompasses a broad range of seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers, cursed treasure hunters, and others who seek riches and fame on the seas.

Pirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some combination thereof. While they are the bane of merchants and coastal communities, they know secrets of the sea and how to avoid aquatic threats. More unusual pirates set their sights beyond the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels, plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore and raid incredible realms.

### Pirate Flags

To terrify opponents and spread their reputations, pirate crews fly distinctive flags. Roll twice on or choose results from the Pirate Flags table to inspire what flag a pirate crew sails under.
