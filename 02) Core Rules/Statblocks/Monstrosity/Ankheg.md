## Ankheg

*Burrowing Insectile Predator*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** None  

Oversize insects, ankhegs burrow close to the surface, creating sprawling underground labyrinths. From these tunnels, they burst forth to dissolve and devour smaller creatures using their acid-dripping mandibles and sprays of digestive enzymes.

Ankhegs are the bane of farmers whose grazing livestock are easy prey for these monsters. Many ankhegs hunt alone, but those in places with ample food might collect in nests of several dozen and threaten whole towns. Ankheg nests can be challenging to wipe out unless the monsters' tunnels are cleared out and their eggs destroyed.

Ankheg tunnels are roughly cylindrical and are often littered with the remains of ankhegs' meals and subterranean treasures. Roll on or choose a result from the Ankheg Tunnel Discoveries table to inspire what might be found in an ankheg's tunnel.
