## Steeders

Giant hunting spiders, steeders prowl the depths of the Underdark. Female steeders grow larger and stronger than males, and the female often devours the male after breeding. Numerous Underdark folk domesticate steeders, particularly duergar (also in this book). Typically the females serve as steeds in battle, while the males are used as draft animals.

Steeders attempt to tear apart perceived threats—and consider even other steeders enemies. When they're put to work, their handlers must stable them separately from one another and place blinders on them to keep them from attacking each other.

Steeders are intelligent enough to learn simple hand signals and vocal commands, but even a domesticated steeder might turn against its handler. Training a steeder requires a rider to bond with it, a process that begins shortly after the steeder hatches. As it grows, its rider works with it to direct its predatory instincts.

Rather than spinning webs, steeders excrete a viscous substance from their legs. This goo allows them to creep along walls and ceilings and to grapple prey.
