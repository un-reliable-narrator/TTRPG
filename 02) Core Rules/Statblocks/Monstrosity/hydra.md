## Hydra

*Multiheaded Serpent of Legend*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Swamp  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Hydras are storied hero slayers with vicious, serpentine heads and infamous regenerative powers. Endlessly hungry, they devour any creatures they catch. Hydras that deplete an area of prey often go into a lengthy torpor until new prey arrives.

Most hydras have five heads, but some mature or battle-tested hydras have more. Such elder hydras might become local legends, known for their battles with heroes or for the riches lost in their domains.

While many hydras claim their own territories, wicked deities might use them to guard treasures or magical sites. Roll on or choose a result from the Hydra Lairs table to inspire why a hydra lurks where it does.
