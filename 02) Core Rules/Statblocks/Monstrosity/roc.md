## Roc

*Avian of Unbelievable Size*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Coastal, Desert, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Birds of prey of fantastic scale, rocs hunt over vast territories and can snatch whole elephants, whales, or wagons in their talons. They then carry their prey back to their remote nests, journeys that can take days and cover hundreds of miles.

Rocs nest amid remote heights. Their nests are typically littered with treasure and uneaten prey. Roll on or choose an option from the Roc Nest Remnants table to inspire what's in a roc's nest.
