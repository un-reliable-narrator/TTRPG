## Weretiger

*Changed by the Power of the Tiger*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Weretigers shape-shift from humanoid forms into tigers or tiger-humanoid hybrids. Although they can transform at will or when their magical nature demands, many weretigers are nocturnal and transform into their bestial shapes at night. Some weretigers' transformations might also be tied to the crescent moon, seasons, or momentous events. Weretigers often view their abilities as a blessing or a family honor, and they use their shape-shifting abilities to defend something with historic importance. Roll on or choose a result from the Weretiger Wards table to inspire what a weretiger defends.
