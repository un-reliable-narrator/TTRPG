## Blob of Annihilation

*All-Consuming Cosmic Entropy Unleashed*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Any  

The blob of annihilation is a coagulation of cosmic entropy conjoined to the remains of dead gods. This malicious entity drifts through Wildspace and multiversal expanses inimical to life—vast regions where the chance of encountering it is low.

The blob poses the greatest threat when disasters or nihilistic magic-users summon it to inhabited realms. Once unleashed, the blob of annihilation rolls across the land in vast, cosmic gyres, with fragments of the blob splitting off to engulf targets. The blob consumes anything it encounters, sweeping forests, villages, and fortresses into its mass. Within the blob is an expanse without air or gravity where entropic forces destroy whatever they engulf. Nothing can survive within for long.

Only magic items and the corpses of gods and titans can endure inside the blob. Because of that fact, treasure hunters and theologians sometimes give themselves the deadly task of trying to retrieve something from within the blob. This quest usually ends in annihilation, but occasionally it results in the find of a lifetime.

When the blob appears, roll on or choose a result from the Blob of Annihilation Contents table to inspire what extraordinary thing remains within its goop.
