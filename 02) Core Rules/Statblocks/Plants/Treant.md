## Treant

*Wise and Mighty Animate Tree*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** None  

Ancient inhabitants of the forest, treants are gigantic, animate trees with wizened faces. Most have lived for centuries and know secrets of the natural world. They avoid becoming embroiled in the conflicts of shorter-lived creatures, but they're protective of their forest homes. If roused to anger, treants can animate trees to aid them.

Treants defend and are shaped by secrets of the forest. Roll on or choose a result from the Treant Secrets table to inspire what mysteries a treant protects.
