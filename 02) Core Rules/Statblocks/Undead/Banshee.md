## Banshee

*Wailing Harbinger of Death*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** [Relics](random-magic-items-relics.md)  

Heralds of doom and plagues on the living, banshees are spirits obsessed by unresolved bitterness or sorrow. These storied phantoms slay any who glimpse them or hear their baleful wails. Although any tormented soul can arise as a banshee, some elven communities particularly fear them and believe that those who hoard or destroy beauty—natural or otherwise—risk returning as a banshee.

All manner of torments might give rise to a banshee. Roll on or choose a result from the Banshee Sorrows table to inspire how a banshee's torment influences its behavior.

**Banshee Sorrows**
