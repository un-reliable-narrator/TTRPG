*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 283*  

Flaming skeletons burn with unbridled necromantic energy. This magic grants them blazing attacks and greater awareness, which they use to command lesser Undead.

## Skeletons

*Ossified Evil*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

**Skeleton Pantomimes**
