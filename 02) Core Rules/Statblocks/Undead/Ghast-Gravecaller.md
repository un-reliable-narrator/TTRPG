Ghast gravecallers wield fell magic and converse with corpses. They might pose as liches or vampires.

## Ghasts

*Tyrants among Corpses*

- **Habitat.** Swamp, Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Ghasts are reeking, undying corpses closely related to ghouls. They hunger for the vices they enjoyed in life as much as they do for rotting flesh.
