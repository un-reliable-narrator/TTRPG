> The life cycle of Yeenoghu's gnolls begins and ends with eating. They eat their enemies, they eat one another, and they're freed from their hunger only in death.

Sometimes the gnolls of Yeenoghu turn against each other, perhaps to determine who rules a war band or because of extreme starvation. Even under ordinary circumstances, gnolls that are deprived of victims for too long struggle to control their hunger and violent urges. Eventually, they fight among themselves.

The survivors devour the flesh of their slain comrades but preserve the bones. Then, by invoking rituals to Yeenoghu they bring the remains back to a semblance of life in the form of a gnoll witherling.

Witherlings travel with their comrades and try to kill anything in their path. They don't eat and aren't motivated by hunger, leaving more flesh for the rest of the war band.
